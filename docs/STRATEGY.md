## Single File Development Strategy

We're developing an ArcGIS Pro Forest Classification Tool that was experiencing issues with hanging during multi-threaded processing at 41% completion.

After extensive debugging of the complex modular architecture, we've decided to restart development using an incremental single-file approach. This strategy allows us to build and test functionality step-by-step, ensuring each phase works before adding complexity.

The goal is to create a working toolbox that processes ~56 feature layers for forest classification while avoiding the debugging challenges of the previous modular system.

## Prerequisites

1. **Read project instructions**: Please read and understand the project instructions in `.config\.vscode\instructions\` before proceeding. These files contain important project standards, workflows, testing requirements, and agent guidelines that must be followed throughout development.
2. **Analyze existing codebase**: Use semantic search and #codebase analysis tools to understand the original implementation patterns, data structures, and business logic that need to be preserved in the single-file version.
3. **Start implementation**: Begin implementing Phase 1 in the current file `single_file_python_script\toolbox_0_1_1.py`, following the incremental development plan below.

### File Naming Convention

Use semantic versioning format `toolbox_0_{phase}_{patch}.py` where:

- **Phase number (minor)**: Changes when moving to a new phase (e.g., `toolbox_0_1_x.py` for Phase 1, `toolbox_0_2_x.py` for Phase 2)
- **Patch number**: Increment on each file save/iteration within the same phase (e.g., `toolbox_0_1_1.py` â†’ `toolbox_0_1_2.py`)

### Development Rules

- **Test each phase** before proceeding to the next
- **Preserve all working functionality** when moving between phases
- **Document changes** and reasoning in code comments
- **Before handing off to the user:**
  - **Add new files** to `git`
  - **Commit changes** to `git`
  - **Clean cache** by running task `cache_cleanup`
- ~~**Follow ArcGIS Pro `.pyt` toolbox standards** throughout development~~

### Testing Strategy

For each file we work on, create a corresponding test file `test_{filename}.py` in `single_file_python_script\tests` to validate functionality before proceeding to the next phase. See `single_file_python_script\tests\README.md` for detailed testing conventions and examples.

## Success Criteria

The key advantage of this approach is that at each phase, you have a **working, testable version** that builds incrementally on the previous one. If any phase introduces issues, you can easily identify what changed and fix it before moving forward.

By the end of Phase 12, you will have a fully functional ArcGIS Pro Forest Classification Tool that can be further modularized in Phase 13 if desired. This methodical approach minimizes debugging complexity and ensures steady progress toward the final goal.
