# VS Code Agent Log for ArcGIS Pro Python Toolbox Testing

---

## Purpose

This log documents the complete troubleshooting, configuration, and best practices for running ArcGIS Pro Python toolbox tests in VS Code. It is intended for future maintainers and agents working in this workspace.

---

## Key Decisions & Rationale

- **Environment Management:**

  - All Python interpreter and tool paths are set via environment variables in `.env` for portability and maintainability.
  - The ArcGIS Pro conda environment (`arcgispro-py3-3780`) is used for all testing and development.

- **Test Framework Selection:**

  - Migrated from `pytest` to `unittest` due to stability issues with ArcPy imports and test hangs/crashes in VS Code Insiders.
  - Unittest is preferred for ArcGIS Pro toolboxes to avoid compatibility issues.

- **Test Discovery Restriction:**

  - Test discovery is limited to the `LOREM` directory to isolate problematic files and speed up debugging.
  - Simple test files (`test_basic.py`, `test_simple.py`) were created in `LOREM` to verify configuration and isolate issues.

- **VS Code Configuration:**

  - `.vscode/settings.json` is configured to use environment variables for interpreter paths and test discovery args.
  - Only essential tasks remain in `.vscode/tasks.json` (e.g., `cache_cleanup`). Redundant test tasks were removed.
  - `.env` contains all necessary environment variables for interpreter and tool paths.

- **Troubleshooting & Debugging:**

  - Test hangs and crashes were traced to VS Code Insiders; VS Code Stable works as expected.
  - ArcPy import errors were isolated and documented.
  - All configuration changes were iteratively tested and validated.

- **Documentation & Knowledge Transfer:**
  - This log omits redundant configuration examples, focusing on decisions, rationale, and lessons learned.
  - All troubleshooting steps, configuration changes, and best practices are documented for future maintainers.

## Best Practices

1. **Use Environment Variables:**

   - Set all interpreter and tool paths in `.env` for portability.
   - Reference environment variables in VS Code settings and tasks.

2. **Prefer Unittest for ArcGIS Pro:**

   - Avoid pytest for ArcGIS Pro toolboxes due to compatibility issues.
   - Restrict test discovery to safe directories (e.g., `LOREM`).

3. **Minimize Configuration:**

   - Keep `.vscode/settings.json` and `.vscode/tasks.json` minimal and maintainable.
   - Remove redundant tasks and configuration options.

4. **Document All Decisions:**

   - Maintain a comprehensive agent log documenting all troubleshooting, configuration, and best practices.
   - Update the log as new issues and solutions arise.

5. **Validate in VS Code Stable:**
   - Confirm all test discovery and execution in VS Code Stable before troubleshooting in Insiders.

## Troubleshooting History

- Initial configuration used pytest, leading to test hangs/crashes due to ArcPy imports.
- Migrated to unittest, restricted test discovery to `LOREM`, and created simple test files for debugging.
- Environment variable-based configuration implemented for interpreter and tool paths.
- Redundant tasks and configuration options removed for maintainability.
- Test discovery and execution confirmed working in VS Code Stable.
- Comprehensive agent log created for future maintainers.

## Lessons Learned

- Prefer unittest for ArcGIS Pro toolboxes.
- Restrict test discovery to safe directories.
- Use environment variables for all interpreter and tool paths.
- Minimize configuration and document all decisions.
- Validate in VS Code Stable before troubleshooting in Insiders.

## Next Steps for Maintainers

- Review and update this log as new issues and solutions arise.
- Ensure all configuration files are up-to-date and minimal.
- Continue to use environment variable-based configuration for portability.
- Document all troubleshooting and best practices for future maintainers.
